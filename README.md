# DecodeXSN
Simple Qt program to extraxt image from xsn file generated by xsensorprod software 

This simple software try to grab some data from the binary file exported from "xsensor PX100:36.36.02".

### rules found

1. each frame starts with this series of byte [-2, -54, -83, -34, -87];
1. images have 16bit depth and the dimensions are the same of the sensor (36 rows and 36 cols for us);
1. if we define the "-2" as the "START" indices we can found this data:
  1. at [START+12 START+13] there is the BYTE OCCUPIED FROM IMAGE as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+16 START+17] there is the YEAR as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+18 START+19] there is the MONTH as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+20 START+21] there is the DAYOFWEEK as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+22 START+23] there is the DAYOFMONTH as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+24 START+25] there is the HOUR as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+26 START+27] there is the MINUTES as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+28 START+29] there is the SECONDS as int16 little endian
  1. at [START+30 START+31] there is the MILLISECONDS as int16 little endian
  1. at START+48 starts the image made of UINT16 little endian
